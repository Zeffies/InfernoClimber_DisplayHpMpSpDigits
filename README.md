Displays your HP as digits after the HP Bar, replacing the text that says FULL when at FULL HP. Will eventually have SP and MP as digits as well, and the option to choose which are displayed as digits / what colour those digits are.
Also optionally fixes it so your HP/MP Bar actually looks full when you're at full HP/MP.
